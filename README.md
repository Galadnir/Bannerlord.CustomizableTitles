A small mod that adds customizable titles to Mount & Blade: Bannerlord. Additionally, the names of owned villagers and caravans, and the names of armies belonging to lords can also be customized.
These options can be set in a general manner for kingdoms and cultures depending on clan tier or relation to the ruler or more specific, for individual characters or clans.

When there are multiple sets of properties for the same lord they are merged together. In general, the more specific property takes priority over less specific properties when merging.
For example:
A lord belongs to the clan "fen Seanel" and to the culture "Empire". There are rules defined for both the culture "Empire" and the clan "fen Seanel", then all properties defined for the clan "fen Seanel" overwrite all such properties in "Empire" for this lord, but all properties in "Empire" which are undefined in "fen Seanel" are still used.

# For Modders

Modders of (total) conversion mods can also use the configuration UI of this mod to create and export a title configuration to include in their mod. That configuration is then automatically loaded by this mod if this mod is also installed by the user. When exporting a configuration, it is possible to set a UID, which can in the future be used to update your configuration by exporting a new configuration with the same UID.
